# Social-and-Economical-Variables-on-COVID-19-Deaths
This study aimed to investigate the deaths in England from COVID-19, and its predictors among patients. 
The large number of COVID-19 deaths in England brings about the hypothesis that there might be other factors that have a connection with the COVID-19 mortality of individuals. 
The objective of this work is to inspect and analyse the connections between social and economic variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, health, heating, social grade, travel to work and COVID-19 deaths. 
Each variable was analysed firstly by checking for normality through visualisation and statistical test. 
The data was then normalised per thousand population which was then ready for analysis. 
A correlation test was then carried out on all variables to test the relationship each variable has with the other. 
Before building the regression model, I needed to ascertain if factor analysis would have been needed which the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin statistics test was used. 
With the factor analysis not being needed, choosing independent variables to build model was based on the degree of correlation the variables have with each other. 
The first model was built using all the variables to identify the significant variables in the set. 
Afterwards, the variables with no significance to first model were taken out and the focus remained the significant variables.  
At the end of the analysis, it was observed the bad health, age group 20 to 29, no heating in homes, Asians, and middle-class citizens all had a significant connection with COVID-19 deaths. 
For other models, old age and public transport were also significant factors but due to collinearity between variables, all these variables could not be in the same model and give close to an accurate result.
